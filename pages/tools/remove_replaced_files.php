# 1. Resource must exist i.e. exclude resource_log entries for fully deleted resources.
# 2. Resource log entry must contain preview_file_alt_ref - this is only set when replacing an original file.
# 3. Resource alt file data should have blank name, description, file_name and 0 file_size - as set by the code
#    used to create the alt file by the replace file feature.
